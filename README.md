[Reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable) and [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) packages applied on the dataset into an interactive HTML document.

## Long Description
The table here shows the [gtcars](https://gt.rstudio.com/articles/gt-datasets.html#gtcars) dataset from the gt package which has information on expensive and fast cars from 2014 to 2017. The table was built using the [reactable package](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) combined with [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) to allow HTML widgets to communicate with each other without R Shiny. Features in the interactive-HTML include [d3scatter plots](https://github.com/jcheng5/d3scatter), crosstalk filter controls, column name tooltips, embedded flag images, row selection, and conditionally formatted cells with icons and bar charts. The example shows some of the capabilities of reactable combined with crosstalk.
