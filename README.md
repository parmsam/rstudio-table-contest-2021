## Short Description

## Long Description
The table here shows the gtcars dataset from the gt package which has information on expensive and fast cars from 2014 to 2017. The table was built using the reactable package combined with crosstalk to allow HTML widgets to communicate with each other without R Shiny. Features in the interactive-HTML include d3scatter plots, crosstalk filter controls, column name tooltips, embedded flag images, row selection, and conditionally formatted cells with icons and bar charts. The example shows the capabilities of reactable combined with crosstalk.
